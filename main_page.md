## Projects

Before you learn how to manage projects, **visit first** [starting project](user-documentation/project-docs/project.md) section.

If you (and your colleagues) already have an working account and you started your first project then it is time to learn how to manage it! To do so, check out our documentation first and you will be ready to dive into:

* Managing project [files](user-documentation/project-docs/files.md)
* Working with [calendar](user-documentation/project-docs/calendar.md)
* Using [project planner](user-documentation/project-docs/planner.md)
* Applying [todo](user-documentation/project-docs/todo.md) actions
* Disscussing project [issues](user-documentation/project-docs/issues.md)
* And more to come ;)

## Explore 

So you have your first started - that's really good! Now you can look at other projects using our [Explore](user-documentation/explore-docs/explore.md) subpage. It enables you to exchange information with scientists from different institutions, learn about their work and share your own achievements.
